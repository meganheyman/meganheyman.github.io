        <h3>
          Offering:  In-person meetings occur on Mon. and Thurs. at 9am.  Online sections meet asynchronously on Tues. and Fri.

          Degree Requirements:  This course counts toward
          <ul>
          <li>Statistics & OR Core for math majors</li>
          <li>Statistics minor</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          This course introduces students to the analytical tools needed to establish the properties of common statistical methods. 
	  We will answer questions such as: "Why do sampling distributions of many statistics become bell-shaped with large sample sizes?"
	  "When is the sample mean the best estimator for the population mean?" and "What do we mean by "best" estimator?"
	</p>
	<p>
	While building a proper foundation for inference, we emphasize the application of theory throughout the course. 
	The course makes use of computing as a bridge between classical theory and 
	the modern approaches used characterize statistical methods.
	</p>
	<p>
	This class will help prepare students to engage in the statistics literature at an introductory level. 
        Particularly, this class is aimed toward students considering graduate-level work in statistics. It does require a firm grasp of probability.
        </p>
          
          
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>
        As in any statistics course, we emphasize statistical literacy and reasoning. 
        This class also emphasizes the underlying theory of statistical methodology. 
        Specifically, after taking this course, you will be able to:

	<ul>
	  <li> Describe the role of probability theory in statistical inference for a population. </li>
	  <li> Compare and contrast modes of convergence and describe their role in sampling distributions. </li>
	  <li> Construct a proof to establish a property of an estimator or sequence of random variables. </li>
	  <li> Given an analysis situation, formulate research questions as measurable statements about parameters in the population. </li>
	  <li> Associate a statistical method with various statistical properties such as consistency, unbiasedness, and asymptotic normality. </li>
	  <li> Clearly communicate statistical theory and its applications. </li>
	  <li> Compare and contrast mathematical and statistical thinking. </li>
	</ul>
