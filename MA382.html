          Have you had an introductory course in probability?  Are you interested in hands-on data analysis?  Then this is the course for you.  In
          MA382, we dive into basic theory surrounding the field of statistics while motivating all of the topics with real data analyses.  Students
          who take MA382 have the opportunity to

          Essentially anyone working in STEM needs the ability to analyze data.  This course gives you base knowledge to be able to perform your
          own data analyses.</p>
        
    <h2>What kind of data analysis skills will I have after this class?</h2>
    <p>You will be able to fit a variety of linear models to data.  We cover basics of confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, study design, and
    sampling.  Methods employed include linear regression and ANOVA.  We perform both parametric (normal, t-distribution) and nonparametric (bootstrap,
    randomization methods) inference.  Throughout the term, you will incorporate the methods through analysis of a large, messy dataset.  You will also be able
    to interpret and create any of the graphics shown below.

    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
      <h4>How are MA382 and MA223 different?</h4>
      <p>
        MA223 (Engineering Statistics) and MA382 technically cover the same statistical methods.  However, the student experience in these
        courses is widely different.  MA223 focuses on engineering applications with little formal theory presented (due to no MA381 pre-req).
        MA223 uses Minitab (point-and-click software) as the main analysis tool and most data analyses utilize small datasets.  MA382 relies on the prior exposure
        to probability to dive a bit deeper into the statistical theory.  For example, why do we use a sample mean to estimate the population mean?
        How does the Central Limit Theorem work, and why might a standardized statistic come from a t-distribution instead of a normal distribution?
        These types of questions are answered without proof in MA223, but formalized in MA382.  Students in MA382 use the R programming language
        for statistical computing and tend to analyze larger datasets.  Topics in MA382 are approached from a linear modeling setting as opposed to
        separate cases in MA223.
      </p>
      
      <h4>If I have taken MA223 already, may I take MA382 for credit?</h4>
      
      <p>
        No, students may only take one of these introductory statistics courses.  They both cover the same topics, but MA382 gives a deeper
        understanding of theory and relies more heavily on programming and computing for analyses.  If you liked your MA223 class, then you should consider
        taking an upper-level statistics course such as MA386 in the fall or potentially getting a statistics minor.
      </p>
      
      <h4>I already took MA381.  How does MA382 differ?  (Both courses have "probability" and "statistics" in the title.)</h4>
       
      <p>
        Although the titles may imply that these courses are very similar, the approaches are quite different.  Probability is a traditional
        area of mathematics.  Probability assumes that certain population distributions and parameter values are known.  Probabilists use that information to perform calculations
        which may be related to the chance of events occurring.  In statistics, the population distributions and parameter values are
        unknown.  You use data in order to estimate parameters and try to learn about the population.  In statistics, we spend a lot of time focusing on
        communication of results and writing.  This aspect is also quite different for most students.
