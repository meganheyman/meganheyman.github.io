          Have you had an introductory course in statistics?  Are you interested in diving deeper into statistical methods that aid in decision-making?
          Then this is the course for you.  In MA487, we make use of data collected from controlled experiments to draw causal conclusions and identify
          important factors to processes.  Students who take MA487 have the opportunity to
        </p>
          <u1>
          <li>Design and implement experiments where we collect and analyze real data.</li>
          <li>Analyze data using the R statistical language and prepare results using Quarto.</li>
          <li>Work in teams to problem-solve and make recommendations driven by statistical analysis, process constraints, and practical needs.</li>
          <li>Formulate a question of interest, implement a full experimental design, and analyze the resulting data.</li>
         </u1>
        <p>
          The setting for this particular class is quite lively.  Students should come prepared to work with classmates on a regular basis, discuss
          ideas during lecture, and actively participate during data collection sessions!
        </p>
          
        <h2>Why is design of experiments important?</h2>
        <p>
        Overseeing processes and improving upon currently utilized methods are two tasks many engineers and scientists face during their career.
        There is pressure to simultaneously increase profit margins and maintain high standards of product integrity.  To improve
        upon current processes, scientists are asked to search for alternative methods or materials than those typically used.  To increase
        profits in our rapidly changing world, innovation is key, and engineers and scientistis are drivers to creating new products.  Moreover, once a product
        is deemed fit for the consumer market, engineers oversee the processes that ensure quality.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A natural intersection of engineering, science, and statistics is through design of experiments.   The statistical tools that comprise the design of
        experiments subject area are integral to the informed decision-making process that engineers utilize in ensuring quality, improving
        product, and innovating processes.  These tools allow scientists to collect data that provides insights to process components
        that are causing improvement or deterioration in product.  Analysis of data collected from a designed experiment may lead to discovery
        of practical process settings that are cost-efficient for the company.  Furthermore, a well-designed experiment has possibility of
        leading to a groundbreaking discovery. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why is statistics important?</h2>
        <p>
          Individuals with strong statistical analysis skills are in high-demand.  Statistician and Data Scientist positions top multiple desirable job lists
          online, and receive lucrative pay
          <ul>

          Essentially anyone working in STEM needs the ability to analyze data.  This course gives you more advanced knowledge for performing your
          own data analyses.</p>
        
    <h2>What kind of data analysis skills will I have after this class?</h2>
    <p>
      You will be able to recommend appropriate designs/statistical models based upon a question of interest.  By carefully selecting the model
      and controlling for sources which contribute to variation in processes,
      the collected data may be used to identify factors which effect a quantitative variable of interest as well as describe the relationships between
      multiple factors and the response.  Topics we cover in this course include K-way ANOVA, factorial designs, block designs, fractional factorial designs,
      and response surface designs.
