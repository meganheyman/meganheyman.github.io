          Have you had an introductory course in statistics?  Are you interested in diving deeper into statistical methods that aid in decision-making?
          Then this is the course for you.  In MA487, we make use of data collected from controlled experiments to draw causal conclusions and identify
          important factors to engineering processes.  Students who take MA487 have the opportunity to
        </p>
          <u1>
          <li>Design and implement experiments where we collect and analyze real data.</li>
          <li>Analyze data using the R statistical language and prepare results using Quarto.</li>
          <li>Work in teams to problem-solve and make recommendations driven by statistical analysis, process costs, and practical needs.</li>
          <li>Formulate a question of interest and implement a full experimental design by the end of the course.</li>
         </u1>
        <p>
          The setting for this particular class is quite lively.  Students should come prepared to work with classmates on a regular basis, discuss
          ideas during lecture, and actively participate during data collection sessions!
        </p>
          
        <h2>Why is design of experiments important?</h2>
        <p>
        Overseeing processes and improving upon currently utilized methods are two tasks many engineers face during their career.
        There is pressure to simultaneously increase profit margins and maintain high standards of product integrity.  In order to improve
        upon current processes, engineers are asked to search for alternative methods or materials than those typically used.  To increase
        profits in our rapidly changing world, innovation is key, and engineers are drivers to creating new products.  Moreover, once a product
        is deemed fit for the consumer market, engineers oversee the processes that ensure quality.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A natural intersection of engineering and statistics is design of experiments.   The statistical tools that comprise the design of
        experiments subject area are integral to the informed decision-making process that engineers utilize in ensuring quality, improving
        product, and innovating processes.  These tools allow engineers to collect samples of data that provide insights to process components
        that are causing improvement or deterioration in product.  Analysis of data collected from a designed experiment may lead to discovery
        of practical process settings that are cost-efficient for the company.  Furthermore, a well-designed experiment has possibility of
        leading the engineer to a groundbreaking discovery in their field.

          Essentially anyone working in STEM needs the ability to analyze data.  This course gives you more advanced knowledge for performing your
          own data analyses.</p>
        
    <h2>What kind of data analysis skills will I have after this class?</h2>
    <p>
      You will be able to recommend appropriate designs/statistical models based upon a question of interest.  By carefully selecting the model
      and controlling for sources which contribute to variation in processes,
      the collected data may be used to identify factors which effect a quantitative variable of interest as well as describe the relationships between
      multiple factors and the response.  Topics we cover in this course include K-way ANOVA, factorial designs, block designs, fractional factorial designs,
      and response surface designs.  Some graphs that you will be able to use/explain by the end of the course are shown below.
