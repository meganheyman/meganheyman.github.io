        <h2>Fostering Critical Thinking Needed To Get Started with Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis</h2>
        
        <p><b>US-COTS 2021 Posters and Beyond Session, Thursday 7/1 </b></p>
        <p><b> Megan Heyman (heyman@rose-hulman.edu) and Annie Liner (Annie.Liner@indstate.edu) </b></p>

        <h2> Indian Monsoon Example </h2>
        <p> <b><a href="USCOTS Example 1.docx">Prompts and Solutions</a></b>:  This file contains prompts that may be used during class or in assignments 
          to discuss spatio-temporal dependence in introductory topics of data exploration, univariate inference for 1 population mean, inference for
          2 population means, and simple linear regression. 
         </p>
         
        <p> <b><a href="Sub_Division_IMD_2017.csv">Dataset</a></b>:  This file contains the full dataset utilized within the Indian Monsoon Example.  
          The data were obtained from the <a href="https://data.gov.in/resources/sub-divisional-monthly-rainfall-1901-2017">Open Government Data Platform India</a>. 
        </p>
        
        <p> <b><a href="JISA_Analysis_Figures.R">R Code</a></b>:  This file contains R code that may be used to create the plots shown within the Indian Monsoon Example.
        </p>
        
        <p> <b><a href="indian_met_zones v2.shp">Shapefile</a></b> and <b><a href="ShapefileNameMatch.csv">Name Match</a></b>:  These files are used to create the
          choropleths of the Indian Monsoon precipitation in the example. </p>
        
        <h2> Some Other Examples </h2>
        
        <p><b>California County Water Usage</b>:  This assignment focuses on inference for two population means, specifically a paired data structure, and why the 
          paired test would not be adequate with these spatio-temporal data.  The assignment questions and solutions may be found <a href="USCOTS Example 2.docx">here</a> and
          the associated data are <a href="USCOTS Example 2 Data.csv">here</a>.  Note that the data are a small subset of the information provided by 
          <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis</a>. </p>
        
        <p><b>Midwest Yearly Snowfall</b>:  The assignment focuses on inference in one-way ANOVA and why the assumption that errors are independent would be 
          unreasonable with these spatio-temporal data.  The assignment questions and solutions may be found <a href="USCOTS Example 3.docx">here</a> and
          the associated data are <a href="USCOTS Example 3 Data.csv">here</a>.  Note that the data were obtained from 
          <a href="https://www.currentresults.com">https://www.currentresults.com</a>. </p>
        
        <p><b>Florida Tropical Storms</b>:  This <a href="USCOTS Example 4 Data.csv">dataset</a> contains county-wise information about damages incurred from
          tropical storms in Florida from 1996 to 2021.  This dataset would work well for data exploration, visualization, and summaries in an introductory
          statistics course.  Notice that some storm events had damage across several counties over consecutive days.  Modeling the dependencies here would
          be especially difficult with the events not equally spaced in time.  Summarizing the data by county and year may be interesting to consider. </p>
        
        <p><b>Tornados</b>:  This <a href="USCOTS Example 5 Data.csv">dataset</a> contains monthly and yearly counts of tornados observed in Oklahoma
           and Texas from 1950-2020 and Nebraska from 1950-2012.  These spatio-temporal data may be interesting to discuss when covering inference for 2 population means,
          ANOVA, and linear regression.  </p>
        
        
        <h2> Selected Links with Spatio-Temporal Climate Data </h2>
        
        <p> <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/">NCDC Storm Events Database</a>:  Records of events from 1950-2021, by U.S. state and county are available
          for several different types of storm types. </p>
        
        <p> <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/">NOAA Precipitation, Temperature, Drought</a>:  Records at over varying land areas (e.g. state, county)
          and time (e.g. monthly and yearly).  Some reformatting would be necessary prior to providing to introductory statistics students.  Students in an intro.
          data science course might perform the reformatting themselves. </p>

        <p> <a href="https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=Category%2Chistoric_wildlandfire_opendata">U.S. Wildfire Records</a>:  Historical records
          of wildfires reported in the U.S.  The full history contains information about the individual wildfire events and there is also information regarding
          the perimeters of the reported events in a separate dataset. </p>
