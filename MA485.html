          Other items of interest:  This course counts towards the Statistics & Operations Research Core for mathematics majors.  It also counts toward
          the statistics minor.
        </h3>

        <p>
          This course delves deeper into ideas of linear regression and introduces time series.  We move beyond the simple linear regression model --
          a single quantitative variable used to predict a quantitative response -- and allow multiple quantitative and
          categorical predictors.  After a short review of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression models are formulated with a more
          general matrix-vector notation.  Applications, analysis, and interpretations of results are the focus in this course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The content of the course is divided into two parts:  multiple linear regression and time series analysis.  Students will have the opportunity
          to complete advanced data analysis projects associated with each of these areas.  
        </p>
        
        
        <h2> Multiple Linear Regression </h2>
        <p>
        Multiple linear regression is a key analysis tool for statisticians and data scientists.  Our approach to this topic begins by deriving
        least squares estimators from the general vector-matrix format of the linear model.  Then, we explore topics associated with linear regression,
        including assessment of assumptions for statistical inference, formal statistical inference, model fit, 
          multi-collinearity, and variable selection.  Specific models,
        including polynomial regression and categorical interactions, are also employed.

        <h2> Basic Time Series Models </h2>
        
        <p>
          Analysis of time series data is a current and challenging topic for STEM researchers.  Data with temporal dependence exists across many fields
          of study. For example, satellites provide the capability for remote sensing,
          and instruments such as the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) collect daily measurements of temperature and precipitation at
          high-resolutions across the globe. Advances in the medical field have yielded complicated fMRI data, which consists of 3-D positional
          measurements of blood flow over time. Understanding traffic flow patterns over time allows for planning and improvement of roadway
          infrastructures. Having the ability to model the spread of contagious disease (for example, Zika virus) may aid in preventative
          actions and resource allocations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Traditional statistical methods assume observations are independent.  This is quite inappropriate to assume in all of the cases
          cited above, since it is highly likely that observations at a given time will depend proceeding observations.  Our treatment of
          time series introduces ideas of autocorrelation, AR(p), MA(q), and ARMA(p, q) models.  The focus is mainly on application and analysis.
