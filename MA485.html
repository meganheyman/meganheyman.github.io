          This course delves deeper into ideas of linear regression.  We move beyond the simple linear regression model --
          a single quantitative variable used to predict a quantitative response -- and allow multiple quantitative and
          categorical predictors.  After a short review of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression models are formulated with a
          general matrix-vector notation.  Applications, analyses, and interpretations of results a focus in this course.  We will use R throughout the term.
        </p>

          Multiple linear regression is a key analysis tool for statisticians and engineers.  Our approach to this topic begins by deriving
        least squares estimators from the general matrix-vector format of the linear model.  Then, we explore topics associated with linear regression,
        including assessment of assumptions for statistical inference, formal statistical inference, model fit, predictions,
          multi-collinearity, and variable selection.  Specific models,
        including polynomial regression and categorical interactions, are covered.  We will also dive into newer topics related to linear regression
        including LASSO and elastic net.

         The short clip below shows examples of some models we will fit during this part of the course.
